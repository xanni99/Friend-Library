## R1: Problems the App Solves:

The app being developed is a ‘Friend Library’ that will allow friends and/or family to make their own library where they can each add all of the books that they own (and are willing to share) and allow everyone else in the group to borrow their books and likewise allow them to borrow the books from other members of the group. In addition to this, it provides a space where books read by friends/family can be reviewed.

The development of this app aims to solve many problems that avid book lovers are currently facing, including difficulty tracking loans amongst friends/family, the cost of living crisis and underutilised book collections (sustainability)

Firstly, when friends or family borrow books, it is easy to lose track of who borrowed what and when, ultimately leading to lost or forgotten books. Additionally, friends that have borrowed a book may have forgotten who it came from, making it awkward for the lender to try and get the book back. The ‘Friend Library’ will provide a structured way to manage the lending and borrowing of books amongst friends/family. Users can request to borrow a book through the app, and the system keeps track of who has borrowed which book and for how long. Users can request how long they would like to borrow the book for, and be given a due date for when the book needs to be returned. Ultimately the app will help ensure borrowed books are returned to the user who owns the book in a timely manner. 

Secondly, the cost of living crisis has meant that “40% of Australian households have struggled to afford household basics in the last three months, and over half of Australians say they will struggle to pay an essential bill over the next three months” (The Salvation Army Australia, 2023). As a result, the cost of living crisis reduces disposable income, making it harder for people to purchase new books. ‘The Friend Library’ provides a cost-effective solution for a group of friends to access a wide range of books, promoting reading and literacy even during economically challenging times. 

Finally, sustainability is a crucial consideration in today's world, particularly regarding the production and consumption of goods. A study by the Pew Research Center found that while the average American reads 12 books per year, a significant portion of personal book collections remain underutilised after initial reading (Perrin, 2016). The ‘Friend Library’ app addresses sustainability concerns by promoting the sharing of books, reducing the need for new purchases, and ultimately minimising environmental impact.
