## R1: Problems the App Solves:

The app being developed is a ‘Friend Library’ that will allow friends and/or family to make their own library where they can each add all of the books that they own (and are willing to share) and allow everyone else in the group to borrow their books and likewise allow them to borrow the books from other members of the group. In addition to this, it provides a space where books read by friends/family can be reviewed.

The development of this app aims to solve many problems that avid book lovers are currently facing, including difficulty tracking loans amongst friends/family, the cost of living crisis and underutilised book collections (sustainability)

Firstly, when friends or family borrow books, it is easy to lose track of who borrowed what and when, ultimately leading to lost or forgotten books. Additionally, friends that have borrowed a book may have forgotten who it came from, making it awkward for the lender to try and get the book back. The ‘Friend Library’ will provide a structured way to manage the lending and borrowing of books amongst friends/family. Users can request to borrow a book through the app, and the system keeps track of who has borrowed which book and for how long. Users can request how long they would like to borrow the book for, and be given a due date for when the book needs to be returned. Ultimately the app will help ensure borrowed books are returned to the user who owns the book in a timely manner. 

Secondly, the cost of living crisis has meant that “40% of Australian households have struggled to afford household basics in the last three months, and over half of Australians say they will struggle to pay an essential bill over the next three months” (The Salvation Army Australia, 2023). As a result, the cost of living crisis reduces disposable income, making it harder for people to purchase new books. ‘The Friend Library’ provides a cost-effective solution for a group of friends to access a wide range of books, promoting reading and literacy even during economically challenging times. 

Finally, sustainability is a crucial consideration in today's world, particularly regarding the production and consumption of goods. A study by the Pew Research Center found that while the average American reads 12 books per year, a significant portion of personal book collections remain underutilised after initial reading (Perrin, 2016). The ‘Friend Library’ app addresses sustainability concerns by promoting the sharing of books, reducing the need for new purchases, and ultimately minimising environmental impact. 

## R2: Allocation and Tracking of Tasks:

Throughout the length of this project, Trello was used as a project management tool in order to help me allocate and keep track of the tasks required. For this project, I ordered my Trello board into 4 lists, and used labels and due dates to identify the importance/priority of each card. 

The colour key for the labels can be found below:

**Initial Trello Board:**

Firstly, I had a Project ‘Overview’ List, which broke the project down into the 6 broad steps that had to be taken in order to submit a complete assignment. By doing this, I was able to establish a timeline using the ‘due date’ feature provided by Trello which gave me an idea of when each step should be completed by. I chose to implement the due dates on the broader steps rather than giving each and every task a due date as not only was this more time efficient, I was unsure of how long each little card (within the other lists) would take.

The other 3 lists included a more specific breakdown tasks. For more complex tasks I further broke these down through the use of Trello’s ‘Checklist’ feature which allowed me to create more manageable mini tasks. Ultimately, this allowed me to more specifically keep track of what task I was up to. Although the majority of these cards/tasks were planned at the beginning of the project, some additional cards and/or checklist items were added as a greater understanding of the project requirements became clear. 

An example of a card with a checklist can be seen below:

In addition to using Trello for overall project management, GitHub was utilised for version control and code management. With over 40 commits, GitHub provided an efficient way to store, track and manage changes to the code throughout the project.
